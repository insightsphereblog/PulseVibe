            In a world where style is often confined to trends or rigid gender
            rules, movement becomes a powerful form of rebellion—and so does
            what you wear. Whether you're running errands, heading to a
            photoshoot, or embracing a spontaneous night out, the bottoms you
            wear set the tone. At
            DealByEthan.shop, you’ll find a collection curated for freedom, fit, and fierce
            self-expression.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-5">
            From mesh joggers to pride-coded skirts, there are over 520+ designs
            across 20+ bold brands—all created for bodies in motion and
            identities that defy norms.

            both coexist—with room to move.
