          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-5">
            Fruit trees are among the most rewarding plants to grow—providing
            beauty, shade, and delicious harvests season after season. But to
            perform at their best, these trees require more than sunshine and
            water. The right
            <a
              href="https://completegrow.com.au/product/new-advanced-formula-npk-4-18-38-calcium-magnesium/"

              >fertiliser for fruit trees</a
            >
            plays a vital role in promoting healthy roots, abundant blossoms,
            and sweet, full-flavoured fruit.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-5">
            While general-purpose fertilisers might support basic growth, they
            often lack the specific nutrient balance required by fruiting trees.
            That’s why targeted products like
            CompleteGrow’s Advanced NPK 4‑18‑38 + Calcium & Magnesium are emerging as
            game-changers for both backyard growers and commercial orchards
            across Australia.

            Why Fruit Trees Need Specialised Fertiliser
          </h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-5">
            Unlike ornamental trees or lawn grasses, fruit trees undergo a
            demanding growth cycle that includes root development, flowering,
            fruit set, and ripening. Each stage demands a specific nutrient
            focus:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-5 text-gray-700">
            <li>Early growth and root development need phosphorus.</li>
            <li>
              Flowering and fruit setting rely on both phosphorus and potassium.
            </li>
            <li>
              Fruit filling and ripening depend heavily on potassium, with
              calcium and magnesium playing support roles.
            </li>
            <li>
              Nitrogen, while necessary, should be carefully managed to avoid
              excessive leafy growth at the expense of fruit.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-5">
            Using a fertiliser that’s not tailored for fruit trees can lead to
            poor flowering, low yields, and bland or small fruit. For consistent
            performance, the nutrient input must match the tree’s seasonal
            needs.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-500 mt-6 mb-3">
            The Ideal Nutrient Profile: NPK 4‑18‑38 + Ca & Mg
          </h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-5">
            CompleteGrow’s fertiliser solution has been engineered specifically
            for fruit trees, with a nutrient profile that supports their full
            growth and production cycle.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-5">
            <strong>Balanced NPK Ratio</strong>
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-5 text-gray-700">
            <li>
              <strong>4% Nitrogen (N):</strong> Just enough to maintain leaf
              health without overpromoting vegetative growth.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>18% Phosphorus (P):</strong> Excellent for stimulating
              root development and supporting robust flower production.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>38% Potassium (K):</strong> Critical for fruit size,
              colour, sweetness, and stress resistance.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-5">
            This formula prioritises reproductive growth (flowers and fruit)
            over excessive foliage—perfect for trees that are already
            established and heading into their productive years.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-5">
            <strong>Calcium and Magnesium</strong>
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-5 text-gray-700">
            <li>
              <strong>Calcium</strong> strengthens cell walls, reduces fruit
              cracking, and improves storage life.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Magnesium</strong> supports chlorophyll production and
              overall energy metabolism in the plant.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-5">
            These secondary nutrients are often overlooked in standard
            fertilisers but are vital for fruit quality and tree
            health—especially under the challenging conditions of Australian
            climates.

            Benefits of Using the Right Fertiliser for Fruit Trees
          </h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-5">
            <strong>Increased Fruit Yield</strong>: The right nutrient mix
            results in more blossoms, better pollination, and a higher fruit set
            rate. This leads directly to more fruit per tree.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-5">
            <strong>Sweeter, Juicier Fruit</strong>: High potassium levels
            directly influence sugar production and flavour development. You’ll
            notice a significant difference in the taste and size of your fruit
            when potassium levels are optimised.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-5">
            <strong>Stronger, Healthier Trees</strong>: Adequate phosphorus and
            calcium help build a robust root system and stronger branches,
            supporting better nutrient uptake and withstanding weather stresses.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-5">
            <strong>Improved Resistance to Pests and Diseases</strong>: A
            well-nourished tree is naturally more resilient. Balanced nutrients
            help maintain thick leaves, firm fruit, and better immunity against
            common pests and diseases.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-5">
            <strong>Better Storage and Shelf Life</strong>: Calcium improves
            fruit firmness, which means longer-lasting, less perishable
            fruit—ideal for both fresh consumption and longer-term storage.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-500 mt-6 mb-3">
            Tailored for Australian Conditions
          </h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-5">
            One of the standout features of this fertiliser is its formulation
            for Australian conditions. Whether you’re growing citrus in
            Queensland, stone fruit in Victoria, or apples in Tasmania, local
            soil types and climate variations can impact nutrient availability.
            CompleteGrow’s product is formulated to meet these specific
            challenges, ensuring your trees receive what they need—regardless of
            your location.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-5">
            Many Australian soils are sandy, acidic, or low in organic matter.
            This can reduce the availability of essential nutrients like
            potassium and magnesium. By choosing a fertiliser that addresses
            these gaps, you set your trees up for long-term productivity.
          </p>

            Application Tips for Best Results
          </h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-5">
            To get the most from a specialised fertiliser like this, proper
            application is key:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-5 text-gray-700">
            <li>
              <strong>Timing:</strong> Start feeding in early spring, just
              before flowering begins. Continue during fruit development for
              best results. Avoid late-season nitrogen applications to prevent
              off-season growth.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Frequency:</strong> Apply every 2–4 weeks during active
              growth, or as recommended. Liquid formulations are ideal for
              regular feeding.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Watering:</strong> Always apply to moist soil and water in
              thoroughly to prevent root burn and ensure even nutrient
              distribution.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Coverage:</strong> Apply around the drip line of the tree,
              where feeder roots are most active—not just at the base of the
              trunk.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Monitor Response:</strong> Look for improved flowering,
              richer green leaves, and more uniform fruit as signs the
              fertiliser is working.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-500 mt-6 mb-3">
            Ideal for a Wide Range of Fruit Trees
          </h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-5">
            This fertiliser is not just for citrus—it performs exceptionally
            well across many fruit tree varieties:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-5 text-gray-700">
            <li>Citrus (lemons, oranges, limes, mandarins)</li>
            <li>Stone fruit (peaches, plums, nectarines, apricots)</li>
            <li>Pome fruit (apples, pears)</li>
            <li>Tropical fruit (mangoes, avocados, bananas)</li>
            <li>Berry bushes and vines (blueberries, grapes, raspberries)</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-5">
            Whether your trees are in pots, raised beds, or large orchard
            settings, this formulation adapts well to soil and hydroponic
            systems alike.
